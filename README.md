# NN_RGB_FPGA
FPGA Design of a Neural Network for Color Detection

In this project you learn to implement a small neural network on an FPGA. Video lectures explain training of the network and FPGA implementation with VHDL. Real hardware is available as a remote lab. 

The application is color detection in video signals. The code is intended as an educational example.
